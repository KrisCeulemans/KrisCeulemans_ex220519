Question 4: 
select t1.gene_name, (t1.seq_region_end - t1.seq_region_start + 1) as length from gene t1 order by length asc limit 1;
# gene_name, length
'TRDD1', '8'


Question 5:
select t1.chromosome, count(t1.description) as cancercount from gene t1 where t1.description like "%cancer%"
group by t1.chromosome order by cancercount desc limit 1 offset 1

# chromosome, cancercount
9, 5

select count(t3.exon_id) as exoncount from gene t1 
inner join transcript t2 on t1.gene_id = t2.gene_id
inner join exon_transcript t3 on t2.transcript_id = t3.transcript_id
where t1.chromosome = 9

# exoncount
'45679'
